# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Code Quiz

The code quiz is a great way to gauge how you're doing in the class. 

The motivation behind this project was to create a simple code quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to see how the user is doing compared to their classmates. 

To get this project up and running you can follow the deployed GitHub Pages link below: 

[Deployed application](https://mcquo011.github.io/Web-APIs-Code-Quiz/)

## Installation 

Used git clone to connect my repo to my local device.

## Usage

This quiz can be used to test a user's knowledge on basic coding. To play the quiz, press the start game button. The user will get 60 seconds to answer four questions. Be careful, because with every wrong answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. Once finished, the user can see their score and submit their initials. This will bring them to the highscore page so they can compare their score to others. 

## Contributing
