# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Code Quiz

The code quiz is a great way to gauge how you're doing in the class. 

The motivation behind this project was to create a simple code quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to see how you're doing compared to your classmates. 

## Installation 

Used git clone to connect my repo to my local device.

## Usage

This quiz can be used to test your knowledge on basic coding. To play the quiz, press the start game button. You'll get 60 seconds to answer four questions. Be careful, because with every wrong answer, 10 seconds get deducted from the timer. Once finished, the user can see their score and submit their initials. This will bring them to the highscore page so they can compare their score to others. 

## Contributing

HTML, CSS style sheet, and JavaScript by Maggie McQuown.
